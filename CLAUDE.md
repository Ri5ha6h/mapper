## Plan Mode

- In all interactions, plans and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Follow `./.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/SKILL.md` for react and nextjs guidelines.
- Follow `./.claude/skills/frontend-skill/SKILL.md` for frontend skills.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.

---

## Plan Storage

- Store all implementation plans in the current workspace `./.claude/plans/` folder.
- Use descriptive kebab-case file names: `feature-mapper-flow.md`.
