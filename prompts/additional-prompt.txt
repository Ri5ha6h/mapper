Would you like to add a DSL feature for defining mappings programmatically?

prompt 2:

Create a plan for below and ask questions:
- Yes, add a DSL feature for defining mappings programmatically
- Add a generate result button, once click it will show a modal where there will be resizable windows. One for script, another one for input, and last on for output.
- The script should be langauge agnostic
- Input will be current source file and I should be able to modify it and again test it within the modal
- Output will be based on the current mapping


prompt 3:

Create a plan for below and ask questions:
- the script in the modal should give options for selecting the language, some languages that I want to include are: Javascript, Typescript, Groovy, Java, Python, C Sharp
- Also give me two more buttons in the modal. First button to copy a json file which will include all the three things script, input and output. Second button should be able to download the same json file which will have all the three things script, input and output.

Prompt 4: 

Copy and download button should give option to either copy or download raw one or dsl one

Raw one
{
  "script": "...",
  "input": {...}, // raw
  "output": {...}, // raw
  "language": "Groovy"
}

Dsl one
{
  "script": "...",
  "input": {...}, // dsl
  "output": {...}, // dsl
  "language": "Groovy"
}

Prompt 5:

Create a plan for below and ask questions:
- the script should show the actual language, If I select groovy then it should actually show the groovy implementation of the mapping done
